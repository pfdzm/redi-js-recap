/**
 * TODO: Implement the FizzBuzz algorithm by following these steps:
 *
 * 1. Create a function called fizzBuzz that takes a number parameter n
 *
 * 2. Inside the function, write a for loop that:
 *    - Starts counting from 1
 *    - Continues until it reaches n
 *    - Increments by 1 each time
 *
 * 3. For each number in the loop, add if/else conditions to:
 *    - Print "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5
 *    - Print "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
 *    - Print "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5
 *    - Print the number itself if none of the above conditions are met
 *
 * 4. Test your function by calling it with different numbers
 *
 * Hint: Use the modulo operator (%) to check if a number is divisible by another number
 * For example: 15 % 3 === 0 means 15 is divisible by 3

/**
 * BONUS: Implement a function that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to n
 * 
 * 1. Create a function called fibonacci that takes a number parameter n
 * 
 * 2. Inside the function:
 *    - Create variables to track the previous two numbers in the sequence
 *    - Start with 0 and 1 as the first two numbers
 * 
 * 3. Use a while loop that:
 *    - Continues as long as the next number is less than or equal to n
 *    - Calculates the next number by adding the previous two numbers
 *    - Prints each number in the sequence
 *    - Updates the previous two numbers for the next iteration
 * 
 * 4. Test your function with different values of n
 * 
 * Example: fibonacci(10) should print: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
 * 
 * Hint: The Fibonacci sequence is formed by adding the previous two numbers
 * to get the next number in the sequence
