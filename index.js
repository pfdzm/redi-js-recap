 */
/**
 * TODO: Implement the FizzBuzz algorithm by following these steps:
 *
 * 1. Create a function called fizzBuzz that takes a number parameter n
 *
 * 2. Inside the function, write a for loop that:
 *    - Starts counting from 1
 *    - Continues until it reaches n
 *    - Increments by 1 each time
 *
 * 3. For each number in the loop, add if/else conditions to:
 *    - Print "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5
 *    - Print "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
 *    - Print "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5
 *    - Print the number itself if none of the above conditions are met
 *
 * 4. Test your function by calling it with different numbers
 *
 * Hint: Use the modulo operator (%) to check if a number is divisible by another number
 * For example: 15 % 3 === 0 means 15 is divisible by 3
