# JavaScript Recap Exercise

This exercise covers fundamental JavaScript concepts through practical coding tasks. You'll work with DOM manipulation, async programming, and basic algorithms.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Open your browser to the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`)

## Tasks

Open `index.js` and complete the following exercises:

1. **FizzBuzz**: Implement the classic FizzBuzz algorithm
2. **Fibonacci**: Create a function that prints the Fibonacci sequence
3. **DOM Manipulation**: 
   - Add "Hello DOM" text to the webpage
   - Display person data from an array
4. **Theme Toggle**: Add a button that switches between light and dark themes
5. **API Integration**:
   - Fetch data from an API
   - Create UI components with the fetched data
   - Add a refresh button for new data

## Tips

- Read the detailed comments above each function for step-by-step instructions
- Use the browser's console (F12) to see your output
- Test your code frequently as you work
- Don't hesitate to use MDN Web Docs for reference

## Need Help?

- Review the hints provided in the code comments
